ready to go.

## Usage
This application was designed for you to log upcoming trips 
and be able to budget them accordingly. You will first be prompted
to create an account or sign in via  google with omniauth. Once 
you are signed in, you will have the ability to create a new trip.
From here, you will log your destination information and price. Next,
you will log flight details and price. Lastly, you will log trip notes
and a budget you have for the trip. Once all three are compiled, You 
will be able to see your trip details displayed with a financal 
breakdown and how much you are either above or below your expenses.

## Roadmap
I have been very excited to bring this application to life. A few
additions I will be making in my spare time are as followed. 
Implimenting a scraper for flight data is the first thing I am 
looking to add. This will serve as a way to get real up to date 
flight pricing for the user. Another addition I would like to add
is a currency converter that will later also use a scraper to gather
up to date currency conversions.
